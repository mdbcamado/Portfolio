    "This report examines the connection between music data from Discogs and discussions on Reddit over three years (January 2020 to August 2022), aiming to uncover music trends that could help shape industry strategies. We looked at Discogs for the numbers on music releases and Reddit for what people are talking about.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Our approach involved organizing and cleaning up data from both sources, getting rid of any duplicates or irrelevant information. We then compared how often artists and their music are mentioned on Reddit with their popularity on Discogs, seeing mentions as a sign of popularity.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The study found that genres like Electronic and Rock are not only often released but also talked about a lot on Reddit. Legendary artists such as David Bowie and Elvis Presley remain hot topics, showing that sales aren't the only measure of success.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Recommendations for future research include enhancing matching capabilities through natural language processing (NLP) for a more nuanced identification of artists and album mentions. The report also suggests sentiment analysis to gauge qualitative aspects of music popularity, offering a layered understanding beyond mention counts. Exploring sentiments from video credits is proposed for a multimedia context. Lastly, a call for dynamic analysis of music trends over time, considering internal and external factors, aims to provide predictive insights into emerging trends.\n",

    "These insights and recommendations lay the groundwork for future research, addressing limitations and paving the way for a more holistic understanding of music trends and discussions in the digital landscape.\n",

    "We acknowledge that our study only looked at what's written and didn't consider the full range of user interactions. Despite this, the findings highlight the importance of social media in understanding what music is popular or what could potentially be a hit."

    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Frequency Analysis**: Perform counts of genre and artist mentions using Python or SQL.\n",
    "    - *Top Genres (2020-2023)*: Determine the top 10 genres by the number of new releases over the specified years.\n",
    "    - *Top Artists (2020-2023)*: Find the top 10 artists by the count of their new releases over the specified years.\n",
    "    - *Monthly Top Artists Analysis*: Identify the top 10 artists each month based on the number of new releases.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Popularity Metrics**: Compile mention counts and upvotes to gauge popularity.\n",
    "    - Based on the identified *Top Genres*, *Top Artists*, and *Top Monthly Artists*, count the number of posts and upvotes for each is mentioned.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Analysis**: Conduct a monthly analysis to observe trends over time.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**: Develop charts and graphs to visualize the popularity trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Limitations**\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparisons are conducted on a monthly basis to align with the Discogs dataset's structure and modularity. The focus is solely on textual data, including submission titles, body content, and comments. Images and other forms of media (including media captions) are omitted from the comparative analysis. No natural language processing (NLP) or advanced matching techniques are applied; therefore, text comparisons are based solely on exact matches only.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *mention* is defined as an exact match of the artist's full name, or the complete album name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The premise adopted is that any *mention* on Reddit, regardless of context or sentiment, indicates an artist's or album's popularity. Thus, the frequency of mentions correlates with popularity, without considering the post's controversality, or sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Upvotes* on posts are included as a metric because they represent a consensus or agreement among users. An upvote is considered an endorsement, suggesting that the community values the mention or finds it relevant."

Despite The **Jaffa Kid's prominence on Discogs, this artist does not appear among the top discussed on Reddit, suggesting a divergence in audience engagement or musical preference between the two platforms**. The high engagement with David Bowie could be attributed to his enduring legacy and broad fanbase, which actively participates in discussions and upvotes content related to him. Conversely, The Jaffa Kid's appeal on Discogs might reflect a more specialized community or genre that does not overlap as much with the general Reddit user base. **This disparity underlines the importance of considering platform-specific contexts when analyzing an artist's popularity and engagement online**."

Simultaneously, genres with fewer releases still generate active discussions on Reddit, revealing a vibrant online community presence.\n",

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this study, as it relies on text mentions without delving into the depth of user interactions or emotional responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of platforms like Reddit in evaluating popularity and potential success in the fast-paced digital music landscape.\n"
