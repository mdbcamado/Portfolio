    "This study addresses challenges in the e-commerce industry, specifically focusing on refining recommendation engines to offer more precise, unbiased, and relevant results. With the proliferation of e-commerce platforms, users often face difficulties in efficiently matching their queries with accurate product recommendations, leading to time-consuming searches and dissatisfaction. The research methodology involves web scraping data from Lazada, followed by comprehensive data cleansing and lemmatization to enhance the quality of textual information. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique is then applied for vectorization, and cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity are employed for measuring resemblance between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study reveals that the LT recommendation engine outperforms its counterparts, achieving higher similarity scores based on both Cosine similarity and Jaccard distance metrics. However, the conclusion emphasizes the importance of improving data quality and preprocessing methods to further enhance the reliability of similarity matching. Notably, while Lazada's recommendation engine considers visitor product histories, concerns persist regarding inaccuracies and biases. The LT recommends a straightforward approach to address these issues, promoting user satisfaction and trust in e-commerce platforms. The findings underscore the significance of continuous improvement in recommendation systems, offering actionable insights for both users and e-commerce platform owners."

    "E-commerce began with giants like Amazon and eBay, which have been operating online for over 20 years. The e-commerce industry is a billion-dollar entity that continues to grow. Initially catering to domestic populations, these e-commerce platforms have expanded their reach as technology has advanced. Now, customers can effortlessly buy from suppliers worldwide, and remarkably, delivery speeds have increased. As e-commerce has advanced, its features and services have adapted to customer needs, with a particular emphasis on improving the overall customer experience.\n",

    "The Philippines embraced the e-commerce industry in the early 2000s with platforms like *sulit.com*, primarily dealing with second-hand items. However, the real surge in e-commerce occurred in the 2010s with the introduction of *Shopee* and *Lazada*. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the growth of e-commerce in the country as lockdowns prompted a widespread shift to online shopping, making it the preferred choice for consumers ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1225172/philippines-usage-e-commerce-covid-19-lockdown/)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Lazada employs a recommendation engine strategy by storing visitor product histories and generating top product recommendations based on frequent occurrences in those histories. For instance, if multiple visitors explore Xiaomi Redmi, the engine suggests products commonly viewed along their respective paths. This approach comes with notable advantages, including enhanced relevancy due to real visitor behavior and the avoidance of bias toward specific product attributes. However, it poses challenges such as potential infrastructure strain for quick service and the necessity for additional systems to manage visitor behavior at scale. <small> ([source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-you-can-like-lazadaid-blibli-ecommerce-product-pandu-truhandito/)) </small>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its strengths, there is a potential downside to this strategy known as the *filter bubble effect*. This phenomenon can restrict users to products similar to their past preferences, limiting exposure to new and diverse items. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this approach will lead to the discovery of high-quality products.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of skewed recommendations, as reported on platforms like Reddit, highlight these challenges. Users have voiced complaints about unsettling Lazada search recommendations and expressed concerns about inaccuracies in recommendations. Examples include:\n",
    "- [User complaints about creepy Lazada search recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yf4k09/anyone_getting_creepy_lazada_search_recos/)\n",
    "- [Concerns about inaccurate recommendations on Shopee from Lazada](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopeePH/comments/17srszu/bakit_nirerecommend_eto_ng_lazada_its_so_wrong/)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These biases have the potential to impact the overall user experience by narrowing the range of recommendations, potentially hindering user satisfaction and eroding trust in the recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these challenges is paramount for e-commerce platforms to provide fair, accurate, and diverse recommendations. This is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and instilling trust in the platform's recommendation capabilities."

    "Given the challenges identified in e-commerce platforms, a significant problem arises concerning the efficacy of customer query matching. While the recommendation of customer searches is generally acceptable, it frequently inundates users with an extensive array of products, necessitating meticulous sifting through the results. For example, a search for a female's shirt may yield a number of pages of products, many of which may not directly align with the sought-after item.\n",

    "- The accuracy and freshness of the dataset are contingent on the time of extraction, acknowledging potential changes in product listings over time as Lazada often updates their displayed product listings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lazada's product listing pagination is capped at 102, with 40 products listed per page. Consequently, only 4080 products were extracted per category, even if the actual count within a certain category surpasses this limit. Additionally, it's worth noting that Lazada sometimes lists duplicate items (with the same identifier) per page, potentially affecting the overall count and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product availability status (In stock, No stock, Limited quantity) will not be considered in this study. The primary objective is to enhance the precision of matches and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The study will solely focus on product features such as name, description, price, and numerical ratings. It will not delve into the analysis of customers sentiment on reviews.\n",

    "The methodology employed in this study involved a multi-step process to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the collected data. Initial data collection was carried out through web scraping, sourcing information from the e-commerce site Lazada. Subsequently, a thorough data cleansing process was implemented, which included the removal of duplicate entries, elimination of null values, stripping away special characters, and standardizing text by converting it to lowercase. To further refine the textual data, lemmatization using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was applied to reduce words to their base or root forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the data preparation steps, the text data underwent vectorization using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. This transformation allowed the representation of text in numerical vectors, capturing the importance of terms based on their frequency in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two distinct similarity measurement methods, namely cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity, were employed to quantify the resemblance between data points. Cosine similarity gauged the similarity between vectors, while Jaccard similarity measured the likeness between sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the retrieval of results was anticipated, emphasizing the practical application of the methodology. This step involved leveraging the computed similarities to identify and recommend similar items or documents, thereby translating the analytical findings into actionable outcomes.\n",

    "The methodology takes a multi-step approach, starting with lemmatization, efforts are directed towards standardizing the representation of words in both the product at hand and the reference dataset that will be the pool for the product recommendation. This initial step significantly diminishes the diversity of word forms, promoting more simpler and meaningful comparisons. Following lemmatization, the application of **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** comes into play, transforming the lemmatized words into vectors. This dual-stage process not only facilitates the segmentation of text into meaningful units but also generates numerical representations, optimizing the suitability for accurate similarity measurements.\n",

    "A recommendation engine initiates its process by selecting a specific product or reference point. Subsequently, comparisons are made between this starting point and the entire dataset using various methods to identify matches or similarities. This approach allows the recommendation engine to analyze and recommend items that align closely with the chosen reference, providing personalized suggestions based on similarities within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, the dataset contains a diverse collection of women's clothing items sourced from the Lazada e-commerce platform. The recommendation process begins by preselecting a particular product or garment from this extensive dataset. Subsequently, the recommendation engine leverages this initial choice to perform similarity measurements therefore yielding the closest garment that is similar to it. This approach ensures that the recommendations are tuned to the characteristics of the initially chosen product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular product should of course be a part of the data base.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison purposes, Lazada yields two sets of recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1)First set: 5 Related products that came from the same store as of the selected product\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2)Second set: 10 Related products that are from different store\n",
    "\n",
    "The LT also yielded two sets of recommendations purely based on cosine and jaccard similarity scores to have comparison with Lazada's recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main functions were made and it utilized the functions that were described earlier in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    recommender_diff_shop is a function that returns the SKUs of 10 closest products based on the combined scores.\n",
    "    recommender_same_shop has same functionality as the recommender_diff_shop only that it offers from the same store.\n",

    "This code defines a recommender function, recommender_diff_shop, which takes an input index corresponding to a product in a dataset. It retrieves information about the target product, such as name, SKU, seller, and category. The function then filters the dataset to include products from different sellers within the same category. Using lemmatization and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation, it calculates cosine and Jaccard similarity scores between the target product and the filtered products. The combined similarity score, a weighted sum of cosine and Jaccard scores, is computed. Finally, the function outputs and displays information about the target product and the top 10 similar products from different sellers based on the combined similarity scores."

    "1) **Multi-Dimensional Product Matching**:\n",
    "Extend the study to incorporate multi-dimensional product matching, considering factors beyond textual features. Include image analysis, user-generated content, and product attributes to enhance the precision of recommendations, especially in visually-oriented product categories.\n",
    " \n",
    "2) **User Trust and Satisfaction Metrics**:\n",
    "Develop metrics to quantitatively measure user trust and satisfaction in e-commerce recommendation systems. Investigate how different recommendation strategies impact these metrics, providing insights into user perception and platform credibility.\n",
    " \n",
    "3) **Machine Learning Explainability**:\n",
    "Investigate methods to enhance the explainability of machine learning models used in recommendation engines. Address the \"black-box\" nature of some algorithms, providing users with insights into why specific recommendations are made and fostering transparency.\n",
    " \n",
    "4) **Personalization and Privacy Trade-offs**:\n",
    "Delve into the trade-offs between personalization and privacy in e-commerce recommendation systems. Analyze user attitudes towards data privacy and explore strategies to balance personalized recommendations with robust privacy safeguards.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Spelling Correction**:\n",
    "It is recommended to correct the spelling of words, since this will significantly improve the similarity scores of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Similarity Measures**:\n",
    "Other similarity measures may be considered to optimally show the likeness of datasets."

    "\n",
    "The study focuses on addressing challenges in the e-commerce industry, particularly in refining recommendation engines to provide more \n",
    "precise, unbiased, and relevant results. While e-commerce platforms have become essential, challenges such as the filter bubble effect and \n",
    "biased recommendations impact user satisfaction and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was found out that in terms of recommendation purely based on similarity, the LT recommendation engine has better similarity scores using the Cosine similarity and Jaccard distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully increase the confidence in using similarity matching, it is either improve quality of data like error free inputs or improve pre-processing codes that will enable to clean and make-up for the errors or inaccuracies of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard,Lazada, a prominent e-commerce platform, utilizes a recommendation engine strategy that considers visitor product histories. However, concerns about inaccuracies and biases in recommendations have been raised, wherein the LT believes that for inaccuracies and issues to be resolved a simple and straightforward approach might be the key.\n"
